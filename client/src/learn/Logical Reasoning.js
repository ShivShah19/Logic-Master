          <h2>Welcome to the World of Logic and Reasoning!</h2>
          <p>
            Logical Reasoning is a key component of many competitive and
            ability-testing exams in India and abroad. Reasoning questions allow
            organizations to assess a candidateâ€™s problem-solving skills,
            critical thinking capabilities, and capacity for logical and
            analytical thinking.
            <br />
            Logical Reasoning involves the ability to use and understand logical
            connections between facts or ideas. In verbal reasoning, questions
            are expressed in words or statements and require the reader to think
            critically about the language used in order to choose the correct
            answer from the given options. Non-verbal reasoning, meanwhile,
            involves questions presented as images and figures, requiring the
            reader to comprehend how one element relates to another before
            selecting the right answer out of a list of potential answers.
